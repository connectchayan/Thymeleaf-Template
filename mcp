1. What is MCP?

A standardized protocol for enabling AI models to access tools, data, and context.

Defines a consistent way for models, servers, and clients to communicate.

Goal: improve interoperability, safety, and reliability of model-driven systems.

2. Core Principles

Standardization: One protocol, many tools.

Extensibility: Support for custom tools and resources.

Security: Clear boundaries for access control.

Composability: Multiple MCP servers can be combined.

3. Architecture Overview

MCP Server: Hosts tools, data, and actions.

MCP Client: The runtime environment where the model executes (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph, IDE plugin).

Protocol Layer: JSON-RPC over streams (WebSocket, stdio).

Model: AI system that requests actions or context.

4. Key Components

Tools

Exposed functions/models that the LLM can call.

Examples: search APIs, database queries, file operations.

Resources

Structured data that can be queried (documents, vectors, configs).

Events

Server → Client updates (e.g., “file changed”).

Sessions

Context-aware conversations with access to a specific set of tools/resources.

5. Workflow (Step by Step)

Model requests a tool/resource via MCP Client.

Client forwards request using MCP.

MCP Server executes the requested tool/resource.

Response sent back to client → interpreted by the model.

Model continues reasoning with updated context.

6. Security Considerations

Limit tool/resource exposure (principle of least privilege).

Apply authentication & authorization at the MCP Server.

Audit logs for tool calls and resource access.

7. Example Use Cases

AI Agents accessing enterprise databases securely.

IDE copilots retrieving project files via MCP server.

Multi-agent systems coordinating with shared tools.

Plug-and-play integrations (search engines, APIs, cloud services).

8. Tools & Ecosystem (Typical Setup)
Layer	Tools/Technologies Commonly Used
